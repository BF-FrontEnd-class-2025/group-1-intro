I am 31 years old.After completing my
studies in the field of Information Technology and Computer Science, I worked in
the Egyptian market for three years, gaining valuable experience. Following
that, I decided to move to Belgium to explore better opportunities in the
European job market. Since then, I have been striving to integrate into the
local community while continuously working on improving myself, including
enhancing my language skills and further developing my computing expertise.
